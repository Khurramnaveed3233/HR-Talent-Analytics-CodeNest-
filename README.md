## Project Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition patterns across multiple dimensions — demographics, job roles, departments, compensation, and engagement factors — using Power BI. The dashboards consolidate HRIS, survey, and payroll data to uncover attrition drivers, quantify their financial impact, and recommend data-backed interventions.

## Executive Summary

Our analysis reveals that 16% of employees left the organization during the reporting period, with attrition concentrated in specific departments, job roles, and demographic segments. Key findings include:

- Life Sciences and Laboratory Technician roles show the highest turnover rates, costing the business millions in replacement and lost productivity.

- Gender imbalance in technical roles (only 6% female in R&D) limits diversity and innovation potential.

- Mid-career employees (26–35) face the highest attrition risk due to shorter tenure and lower satisfaction.

- Overtime, low performance ratings, and limited career progression are strong predictors of churn.

## Data Sources

- HRIS: Employee demographics, job roles, tenure, department
- Payroll: Monthly income, salary quartiles
- Engagement Surveys: Job satisfaction, eNPS
- Exit Interviews: Attrition reasons
- ATS/Recruitment Data: Hiring pipeline and replacement costs

# HR Attrition & Turnover Analysis – Power BI Project

##  Key Insights & Findings

### 1. Attrition Hotspots

**Life Sciences Department**
- Attrition rate: **39%** (2.3× company average)
- Annual cost: **₹2.8 Cr** in replacement and lost IP
- Primary driver: Limited career growth paths

**Laboratory Technicians**

- 62 exits, concentrated in early tenure
- High turnover despite moderate pay — suggests engagement and career development issues

**Sales Representatives**

- 53 exits, often linked to high travel and performance pressure

---

### 2. Gender Imbalance in Technical Roles

- **R&D**: Only **6% female representation** (37 women out of 587 roles)
- **Impact**: Limits diversity of thought, reduces innovation capacity
- **Recommendation**: Launch targeted *Women in Tech* scholarship and mentorship programs to raise representation to **15%** within 12 months

---

### 3. Tenure & Satisfaction Risk Zones

**26–35 Age Group**
- Avg tenure: **3.2 years**
- Satisfaction: **3.7/5**
- High attrition risk — mid-career professionals leaving for better growth opportunities

**18–25 Age Group**
- Shortest tenure (**1.1 years**) but medium risk — often entry-level churn

**36–55 Age Group**
- Longest tenure (**6.4 years**) and highest satisfaction — low attrition risk

---

### 4. Compensation & Engagement Link
- Salary vs Satisfaction correlation: **r = 0.57**
- Bottom quartile salaries (**₹4.2 L**) → lowest satisfaction (**3.5/5**)
- Top quartile salaries (**₹11.4 L**) → highest satisfaction (**4.3/5**)
- **Recommendation**: Salary band transparency and targeted adjustments for bottom quartile

---

### 5. Performance & Overtime Impact
- Low performance rating employees: **15.6%** of attrition cases — often linked to disengagement
- Overtime workers: Higher attrition (**127 exits**) vs non-overtime (**110 exits**) — suggests burnout risk

---

##  Business Impact
If the organization:
- Reduces Life Sciences attrition from **39% → 15%**
- Increases female representation in R&D from **6% → 15%**
- Improves bottom quartile satisfaction from **3.5 → 4.0**

**Projected Savings**: **₹3.1 Cr annually**  
**Additional Gains**: Higher innovation capacity, improved employer brand, reduced recruitment costs
