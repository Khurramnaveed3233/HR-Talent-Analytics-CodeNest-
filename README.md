## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns across multiple dimensions — demographics, job roles, departments, compensation, and engagement factors — using Power BI. The dashboards consolidate HRIS, survey, and payroll data to uncover attrition drivers, quantify their financial impact, and recommend data-backed interventions.
